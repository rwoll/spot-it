## Usage

Once you've launched the application, the keyboard controls are as follows:

| Keyboard Shortcuts  | Description |
| --------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|  `option` + `space` | hides/shows app                                        |
| `enter`             | selects song to play (defaults to first result)        |
| `↑` / `↓`           | arrows through results                                 |
| `esc`               | hide app and return control to previous app (clicking anywhere outside the window is equivalent) |
